| *calendar*               | Customizable calendar for roleplaying games. This code is *not* for tracking real-world calendars. In particular, it does not support arbitrary adjustments to the timeline. It is suitable, however, for creating fantasy calendars for roleplaying games, which is what it was developed for. |
| *dice*                   | Rolls dice for standard dice notation used in roleplaying games.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
