Toolbox for roleplaying-game-specific code

## calendar
Customizable calendar for roleplaying games.

This library is *not* for tracking real-world calendars. In particular, it
does not support concepts such as leap years, nor arbitrary adjustments
to the timeline. It is suitable, however, for creating fantasy calendars
for roleplaying games, which is what is was developed for.

## dice
Rolls dice for standard dice notation used in roleplaying games.

## names
A very simple name generator based on the 2000 US Census data and the Social
Security Administration's baby name data.
