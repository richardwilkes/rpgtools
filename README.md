Toolbox for roleplaying-game-specific code

## calendar
Customizable calendar for roleplaying games.

This library is *not* for tracking real-world calendars. In particular, it does not support arbitrary adjustments to the
timeline. It is suitable, however, for creating fantasy calendars for roleplaying games, which is what it was developed
for.

## dice
Rolls dice for standard dice notation used in roleplaying games.

## names
A random name generator. The **namer** sub-package provides generators for male, female, and last names based on the
2000 US Census data and the Social Security Administration's baby name data.
